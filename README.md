# time_tracking_chrome_extension

Here I have implemented a chrome extension to track the time spent on each website with the time spent in minutes and seconds .

This is how our extension looks:

After loading the extension

Click on load times button to get the details .

To clear the history and start the tracking from a new point, click on clear times button and load it again and the history will be clear.


To use the extension download the code file from github in a folder
Then go to extensions in google tab and click on load unpacked

and import this folder and pin this extension to use it.
