# time_tracking_chrome_extension

Here I have implemented a chrome extension to track the time spent on each website with the time spent in minutes and seconds .

This is how our extension looks:

After loading the extension

Click on load times button to get the details .

To clear the history and start the tracking from a new point, click on clear times button and load it again and the history will be clear.
